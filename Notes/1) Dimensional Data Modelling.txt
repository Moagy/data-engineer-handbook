Dimensional Data Modelling

Struct (table within a table) + Array (list in a column)

Building more compact datasets

What is a dimension:
- Attributes of an entity
	- Your name, birthday, city you live in etc.
- Identifier dimensions- uniquely identify something
- Attributes- aren't critical to the identification of that entity but help with other forms of analysis
- 2 types of dimensions:
	- Slowly-changing
		- Favourite food (changes over time)
	- Fixed
		- Birthday (can't change)
		- A phone's manufacturer (it was made by Apple, Samsung etc)
Knowing whether a dimension is fixed or slowly-changing. Slowly-changing are more annoying to deal with.

6 topics for this lesson:
Knowing your data consumer
OLTP vs OLAP data modelling
Cumulative Table Design
The compactness vs usability tradeoff
Temporal cardinality explosion
Run-Length encoding compression gotchas

Knowing your custiner
- Data analysts / data scientist
	- Should be easy to query. Not many complex datatypes
- Other data engineers
	- Should be compact and probably harder to query. Nested types are ok
- ML Models
	- Depends on the model and how its trained
- Customer
	- Should be very easy to interpret chart
